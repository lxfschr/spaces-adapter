/** This file describes the native extensions that allows a Spaces application
to interact with Photoshop.

General objects
This following section describes common objects and patterns used by the
interface.

"err"
The err argument is returned as the first argument in a completion callback
provided to a command.
If a command succeeds then the value of the err object is undefined, or
it is an object with a "number" key whose value is 0.
When the command fails, then an object is returned. The returned object has the
following values:
"number" (number, required)
    An error code describing the failure. @see _spaces.errorCodes
"message" (string, optional)
    An english string describing failure.
"stack" (string, optional)
    A stack describing the failure location.
"fileName" (string, optional)
    Name of the file where the error occurred
"lineNumber" (number, optional)
    Line number for the location of the error
"columnNumber" (number, optional)
    Column number for the location of the error


"paintOptions"
This object describes how the Photoshop canvas is updated with respect to
OS drawing.
When this object is not present, then Photoshop will use its default
update logic.
The following keys are recognized:
"immediateUpdate" (boolean)
    If true then the Photoshop canvas is updated immediately. This typically
    means that the canvas is updated after executing one or more commands
    right before executing the completion callback.
"quality" (string)
    Describes the update quality. Possible values are: "draft", "medium", "final".
    When draft is specified then the update may not be fully accurate. "draft" is
    used when a number of subsequent commands are executed. When "final" is specified
    then the canvas is updated fully to its final form. "medium" is a quality that is
    between draft and final.
    When "draft" or "medium" is provided then Photoshop will automatically update
    to "final" at a later time.
"documentId" (int)
    The ID of the document to update. If this key is missing, or if it is less than 0,
    then the active document will be used as the target.

/** Abort the current Spaces interaction.
This API is intended to be used when the HTML session detects an unrecoverable
error. In that case calling "abort" will return the user to the default experience.
By default the Cef session will be destroyed when "abort" is called. See lifetime
discussion below.
An optional dialog can be shown in the host environment after the HTML surface
has been hidden.

Lifetime:
By default the Cef session will be destroyed when "abort" is called. This can be a
problem while developing the HTML application, as you then loose the ability to
introspect the Cef state after "abort" has been called.
To keep the Cef session alive after the call to "abort", you can set the following key to
true in the "Settings.json" configuration file: "dont_destroy_cef_in_abort".
If "dont_destroy_cef_in_abort" is specified, then the Cef session is kept alive after
"abort" is called and you can introspect the Cef state with the Chromium debugger.
After the state has been analyzed, you will need to call "abort" again with forceDestroy
set to true in order to put Spaces into a state that allows for a relaunch of the HTML
experience without a restart of Photoshop.

@param  options      (object)   Specifies options for the operation.
@param  callback     (function) A callback notifier that may be executed in certain
                                cases (see below). If the command is successful then
                                the callback is *not* executed.

"options"
The following keys are recognized:
"message" (string,optional)
    If provided then an alert is shown in the host environment after the HTML surface
    has been hidden. The text of the alert is the contents of message.
"forceDestroy" (boolean,optional)
    Default value is "false". If true, then the Cef session is destroyed regardless of
    the contents of Sessings.json. This parameter is meant to be used only from an
    interactive Chromium debugger console (after the aborted session has been analyzed).

callback(err)
The callback notifier is typically not executed because abort terminates
the HTML session.
If an error occurs while processing abort, or if the host is unable to abort
the current session, then an error is returned.

    The order of the format list is significant. In the case where multiple formats
    match the contents of the clipboard, the first format listed will be used.
    Spaces operates with two types of formats:
    - built-in formats. These formats map to well defined OS formats. The following
        lists the built in formats:
        "string"    This format can be used to read and write unicode string data.
                    The data for the values of type string is "string".
    - custom formats. Any format that is not a built-in format is considered a custom format.
        The custom format can have any identifier. On OSX Apple recommends a UTI syntax such
        as the following for custom formats: "com.mycompany.myapp.myspecialfiletype".
        See the following URL for information about custom types on OSX:
